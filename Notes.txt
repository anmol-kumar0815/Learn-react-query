1. When a fetch request fails react query automatically retry(make an API call again) to fetch data.

2. When useQuery make an api call for the first time and it receive data from api it will cache the data, means if you refresh the
page you will not see loading... because it is displaying the cache data, value of "isLoading" state will always false in this case.

=> But there can be a case when data in database was updated and useQuery is showing cache data

=> For handing this case useQuery provide one more state as "isFetching", basically what happen is when useQuery have cache data
it will display the cache data to the ui but it will make an api call in background to get the updated data and that api call is
completed or not can be identify by "isFetching" state if it is false then data fetched successfuly, if it is true that means
api call is running in background

Note: the default cache store time is 5 minutes after that cache data will go to garbage.

=> if you want to change this default time pass third argument to the useQuery as { cacheTime: 5000 }, means 5 sec.
